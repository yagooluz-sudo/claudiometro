## What this fork adds

### Desktop Widget — "Consumo do Claudinho" (Windows)

A floating always-on-top overlay for Windows that shows your Claude Code session (5h) and weekly (7d)
utilization directly on your desktop — no ESP32 hardware required.

- Pixel-art Clawd animations that react to your usage rate (idle → work → dance)
- Two progress bars with reset countdowns
- System tray support, drag to reposition, position saved between sessions
- Icon generated from the pixel-art assets already in the repo
- Fully in Portuguese 🇧🇷

**Quick start:**

```powershell
cd widget
.\install.ps1
```

See [`widget/`](widget/) for full details.

## 💛 Big thanks to the original creator

Huge thank you to **Hermann Björgvin** for building and open-sourcing Clawdmeter.
The original project is a beautifully crafted piece of work — the firmware architecture,
the BLE protocol, the pixel-art animation engine, and the daemon are all his.
This fork would not exist without it. Go star the original:

A small ESP32 dashboard I made for my desk to keep an eye on Claude Code usage.

It runs on a [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-2.16.htm?&aff_id=149786) and pairs with my laptop over Bluetooth, the splash screen plays pixel-art Clawd animations that get
busier when your usage rate climbs. The two side buttons send Space and
Shift+Tab over BLE HID for Claude Code's voice mode and mode-toggle shortcuts.

|              Usage meter              |              Clawd animation screen              |
| :-----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------: |
| ![Usage meter](assets/demo.jpeg) | ![Clawd animation screen](assets/demo.gif) |

The Clawd animations come from [claudepix](https://claudepix.vercel.app), [@amaanbuilds](https://x.com/amaanbuilds)'s library of pixel-art Clawd sprites, check it out, it's lovely.

## Screens

The device boots into the splash and stays there until you press the middle (PWR) button, which cycles between Usage and Bluetooth. Tap the screen anywhere (except the Reset zone on the Bluetooth screen) to flip back to the splash; tap again to dismiss it.

|              Splash               |              Usage              |                Bluetooth                |
| :-------------------------------: | :-----------------------------: | :-------------------------------------: |
| ![Splash](screenshots/splash.png) | ![Usage](screenshots/usage.png) | ![Bluetooth](screenshots/bluetooth.png) |
|   Splash; touch-toggle anytime    | Session and weekly utilization  |    Connection status and bond reset     |

While the splash is up, the middle button cycles animations instead of screens. The firmware also auto-rotates every 20 s within the current usage-rate group, so a long stretch on the splash isn't just one Clawd on loop.

## Hardware

Two boards are supported out of the box:

- [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-2.16](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-2.16.htm?&aff_id=149786) — ESP32-S3R8, 2.16" 480×480 AMOLED (CO5300 QSPI), CST9220 cap touch, AXP2101 PMU + Li-Po battery, QMI8658 IMU. Three side buttons, IMU auto-rotation. Build env: `waveshare_amoled_216`.
- [Waveshare ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.8](https://www.waveshare.com/esp32-s3-touch-amoled-1.8.htm?&aff_id=149786) — ESP32-S3R8, 1.8" 368×448 portrait AMOLED (SH8601 QSPI), FT3168 cap touch, AXP2101 PMU, QMI8658 IMU, XCA9554 IO expander, 16 MB flash. Two buttons (BOOT + PWR), fixed orientation. Build env: `waveshare_amoled_18`.

Plus per board:

- USB-C cable for flashing firmware and charging
- 3.7V Li-Po battery (MX1.25 2-pin connector, optional)

**Porting to another board:** the firmware is a thin HAL with per-board folders under `firmware/src/boards/`. Drop in a new folder and a new PlatformIO env — `main.cpp`, `ui.cpp`, and `splash.cpp` never need to change. See [`docs/porting/adding-a-board.md`](docs/porting/adding-a-board.md) for the walk-through and [`docs/porting/hal-contract.md`](docs/porting/hal-contract.md) for the interfaces a port must implement.

## Prerequisites

- Linux (tested on Ubuntu) or macOS
- [PlatformIO CLI](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/core/installation/index.html)
- Linux: `curl`, `bluetoothctl`, `busctl` (BlueZ Bluetooth stack)
- macOS: `python3` (the installer sets up a venv with `bleak` and `httpx`)
- Claude Code with an active subscription

## macOS installation

The macOS host pieces — Python daemon, LaunchAgent, and flash helper — were ported by [Chris Davidson (@lorddavidson)](https://github.com/lorddavidson). Thanks Chris!

### Flash the firmware

```bash
./flash-mac.sh                       # auto-detects /dev/cu.usbmodem*
./flash-mac.sh /dev/cu.usbmodem1101  # or pass an explicit USB serial port
```

### Pair the device

After flashing, open **System Settings → Bluetooth** and click *Connect* next to "Clawdmeter". The daemon will discover it on its next scan (~30 s).

### Install the daemon

The daemon reads your Claude OAuth token from the macOS Keychain (service `Claude Code-credentials`), polls usage every 60 s, and pushes it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install-mac.sh
```

The installer creates a Python venv in `daemon/.venv/`, installs `bleak` and `httpx`, renders a LaunchAgent into `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist`, and loads it. The first run is launched interactively so macOS prompts for Bluetooth permission.

Useful commands:

```bash
launchctl list | grep claude-usage                                          # check it's running
tail -F ~/Library/Logs/claude-usage-daemon.out.log                          # live logs
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist  # stop
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.claude-usage-daemon.plist # start
```

## Linux installation

### Flash the firmware

```bash
cd firmware
pio run -t upload --upload-port /dev/ttyACM0
```

### Pair the device

After flashing, the device advertises as "Claudemeter". Pair it once:

```bash
# Scan for the device
bluetoothctl scan le

# When "Claude Controller" appears, pair and trust it
bluetoothctl pair F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5    # use your device's MAC
bluetoothctl trust F4:12:FA:C0:8F:E5
```

The MAC address is shown on the Bluetooth screen — press the middle (PWR) button to cycle to it.

### Install the daemon

The daemon polls your Claude usage every 60 seconds and sends it to the display over BLE.

```bash
./install.sh
systemctl --user start claude-usage-daemon
```

Check status: `systemctl --user status claude-usage-daemon`

View logs: `journalctl --user -u claude-usage-daemon -f`

## How it works

1. The daemon reads your Claude Code OAuth token from `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
2. It makes a minimal API call to `api.anthropic.com/v1/messages` — one token of Haiku, basically free.
3. The usage numbers come straight out of the response headers (`anthropic-ratelimit-unified-5h-utilization` and friends).
4. The daemon connects to the ESP32 over BLE and writes a JSON payload to the GATT RX characteristic.
5. The firmware parses it and updates the LVGL dashboard.
6. The firmware also tracks the rate of change of session % over a 5-minute window and picks splash animations from the matching mood group.
7. The two side buttons are independent of all of this — they send Space and Shift+Tab as BLE HID keyboard input to the paired host directly.

## Physical buttons

The board has three side buttons. Left and right do the same thing on every screen; the middle button is screen-aware.

| Button           | GPIO         | Function                                                       |
| ---------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Left**         | GPIO 0       | Hold to send Space (Claude Code voice-mode push-to-talk)       |
| **Middle** (PWR) | AXP2101 PKEY | Cycle screens (Usage ↔ Bluetooth); on splash, cycle animations |
| **Right**        | GPIO 18      | Press to send Shift+Tab (Claude Code mode toggle)              |

Space and Shift+Tab go out as standard BLE HID keyboard reports, so they trigger in whatever window has focus on the paired host — not just Claude Code.

## BLE protocol

The device advertises a custom GATT service alongside the standard HID keyboard service:

|                            | UUID                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Service**           | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000001` |
| RX Characteristic (write)  | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000002` |
| TX Characteristic (notify) | `4c41555a-4465-7669-6365-000000000003` |
| **HID Service**            | `00001812-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb` |

JSON payload format (written to RX):

```json
{ "s": 45, "sr": 120, "w": 28, "wr": 7200, "st": "allowed", "ok": true }
```

Fields: `s` = session %, `sr` = session reset (minutes), `w` = weekly %, `wr` = weekly reset (minutes), `st` = status, `ok` = success flag.

## Recompiling fonts

The `firmware/src/font_*.c` files are pre-compiled LVGL bitmap fonts.

```bash
npm install -g lv_font_conv
```

Generate each one (one at a time — `lv_font_conv` doesn't like loop-driven invocations) with `--no-compress` (required for LVGL 9):

```bash
# Tiempos Text (titles, 56px)
lv_font_conv --font assets/TiemposText-400-Regular.otf -r 0x20-0x7E \
  --size 56 --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
  -o firmware/src/font_tiempos_56.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"

# Styrene B (large numbers 48, panel labels 28, small text 24, minimal 20)
for size in 48 28 24 20; do
  lv_font_conv --font assets/StyreneB-Regular.otf -r 0x20-0x7E \
    --size $size --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
    -o firmware/src/font_styrene_${size}.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"
done

# DejaVu Sans Mono (32px, with spinner Unicode chars)
lv_font_conv --font assets/DejaVuSansMono.ttf \
  -r 0x20-0x7E,0xB7,0x2026,0x2722,0x2733,0x2736,0x273B,0x273D \
  --size 32 --format lvgl --bpp 4 --no-compress \
  -o firmware/src/font_mono_32.c --lv-include "lvgl.h"
```

**Important:** `lv_font_conv` v1.5.3 outputs LVGL 8 format. Each generated file must be patched for LVGL 9 compatibility:

1. Remove `#if LVGL_VERSION_MAJOR >= 8` guards around `font_dsc` and the font struct
2. Remove the `.cache` field from `font_dsc`
3. Add `.release_glyph = NULL`, `.kerning = 0`, `.static_bitmap = 0` to the font struct
4. Add `.fallback = NULL`, `.user_data = NULL` to the font struct

Without these patches, fonts compile but render as invisible.

### CJK support

`firmware/src/font_cjk_16.c` covers the full CJK Unified Ideographs basic
block (U+4E00–U+9FFF, ~20k glyphs) plus ASCII, CJK punctuation, and
halfwidth/fullwidth forms. Generated from [Noto Sans CJK SC](https://github.com/notofonts/noto-cjk)
(SIL OFL 1.1) at 16px, 2bpp:

```bash
lv_font_conv --font NotoSansCJKsc-Regular.otf --size 16 --bpp 2 \
  --no-compress --format lvgl --lv-include 'lvgl.h' \
  -r '0x20-0x7E,0xB7,0x2014,0x2018-0x2019,0x201C-0x201D,0x2026,0x3000-0x303F,0x4E00-0x9FFF,0xFF00-0xFFEF' \
  -o firmware/src/font_cjk_16.c
```

Then apply the four LVGL 9 patches above. Because the font has >65k of
glyph bitmap data, the build needs `-DLV_FONT_FMT_TXT_LARGE=1` in
`platformio.ini` build flags so font descriptor offsets switch from
16-bit to 32-bit.

The CJK font is used for the Activity screen's user-prompt row and todo
content rows. The headline (28pt Styrene B) and titles stay ASCII-only
to preserve the brand font — Chinese text in those slots renders as
empty boxes. Add a `font_cjk_28.c` if full coverage is needed (~1MB
more flash).

## Converting Lucide icons

The UI uses a small set of [Lucide](https://lucide.dev) icons (bluetooth + battery states) converted to RGB565 / RGB565A8 C arrays for LVGL.

```bash
node tools/png_to_lvgl.js assets/icon_bluetooth_48.png icon_bluetooth_data ICON_BLUETOOTH_WIDTH ICON_BLUETOOTH_HEIGHT
```

Default tint is white (`0xFFFFFF`); Lucide PNGs ship as black-on-transparent and would render invisible against the dark UI without it. Pass `--no-tint` for pre-coloured artwork like the logo. Battery icons use RGB565A8 (alpha plane) so they blend cleanly over the splash; the rest are baked RGB565 over the panel colour. Paste the converter output into `firmware/src/icons.h`.

## Splash animations

The animations come from [claudepix.vercel.app](https://claudepix.vercel.app),
a library of Clawd sprites. `tools/scrape_claudepix.js` evaluates the
site's JavaScript in a Node VM to pull out frame data and palettes, then
`tools/convert_to_c.js` turns everything into RGB565 C arrays and writes
`firmware/src/splash_animations.h`.

To re-pull (e.g. when the source library updates):

```bash
node tools/scrape_claudepix.js
node tools/convert_to_c.js
pio run -d firmware -t upload
```

See `tools/README.md` for details.
